SVG-Utils 0.1
=============

=========
= About =
=========
SVG-Utils is a collection of scripts and a Python library for creating and
manipulating SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) files. It is released under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

This release of SVG-Utils includes scripts that can dump SVG information,
grayscale and recolor SVG images, and overlay one SVG on top of another.

The library supports creating SVG images on the fly, as well as editing them.
This could be used for server-side scripts using mod_python to send out SVG
data to clients (for generated graphs, for example).

===========
= Install =
===========
SVG-Utils includes a custom installation script that can be used to install it.
To use the script to install SVG-Utils:

	tar -xvjf svg-utils-0.1.tar.bz2
	cd svg-utils-0.1
	./install

For a list of custom options and paths that can be passed to the install script,
use './install --help'. The syntax is similar to the standard configure scripts
that are included with most applications.
