TODO list: this is what I find most important to do (in order of importance). Your opinion may differ.
If you have requests or some new icons (in here or not), please leave a post in our forums.

Icons for
- USB device (I don't like the gnome one, the USB sign is too small, and it doesn't have to be a hd.)
- Menu Editor and Menu Updating Tool
- Bookmark Tabs as Folder and Bookmark Toolbar
- Amarok
- Konversation
- Some nice KOffice Logo
- KNewsTicker
- KWifiManager
- Gwenview & KView (one of them could get the gqview icon)
- KGpg, KFloppy, World Clock, Tea Cooker, AMOR
- KDE-SDK: KDevelop, Umbrello, KBugBuster, babel fish, Kompare, Qt Utilities
- KNetAttach
- Game Categories (Arcade, Board Games, Tactics & Strategy)
- More game icons: KSnakeRace (take the python icon), Atlantik, KAsteroids, etc.
- Edutainment (and Subcategories: Languages, Mathematics, Miscellaneous, Science, Teaching Tools)
- KBear, maybe. You'll have a hard time convincing me to draw a bear.

other TODO items:
- write an autosync-script
- Make the Superkaramba guys drop that crappy bomb as system tray icon and use their own one.
  Or better, tell them to drop the system tray icon as a whole, hardly anybody needs that.
- update all the icons to have them rendered much better from SVG source in KDE

easy TODO items:
- see if there is some charismatic bitmap icon anywhere
- discuss with the other devs:
  > semantics - which icon has which meaning?
  > consistency - I think of different openoffice.org, KOffice, Gnumeric icons, and such.
