TODO list: this is what I find most important to do. Your opinion may differ.

Icons for
- Kontact summary view, KOrganizer reminder daemon
- Kopete (including offline, some away, all away & some online icons)
- Konqueror toolbar buttons: FSView & Gwenview Image View
- Konqueror (unique icon instead of generic world)
- KwikDisk and KDiskFree
- Menu Editor and Menu Updating Tool
- Bookmark Tabs as Folder and Bookmark Toolbar
- Amarok (new wolf howl icon)
- Konversation and KSirc (although, the original KSirc almost looks like native Lila :-)
- KOffice Logo
- Info Center
- KNewsTicker
- KWifiManager
- Gwenview, Kuickshow & KView
- KGpg, KFloppy, World Clock, Tea Cooker, AMOR
- KBear
- Umbrello
- Debugger and KBugBuster
- Game Categories (Arcade, Board Games, Card Games, Tactics & Strategy)
- Edutainment (and Subcategories: Languages, Mathematics, Miscellaneous, Science, Teaching Tools)

Things that can be done with relatively low amount of work:
- actions/player_mute: combine the mute and volume-zero icons from gnome stock
- filesystems/link, lockover and zip icons should be easy
