TODO list: where you can go if you want to do something and don't know what.
If you have requests or some new icons (in here or not), please leave a note in our forums.

Icons we could need:
- fileimport, and adapt fileexport
- Menu Editor and Menu Updating Tool
- Scribus
- KDE 3.5 - apps: kttsd, fifteenpieces (puzzle applet), kbinaryclock
- KDE 3.5 - devices: ipod -> ipod_unmount, laptop
- Some nice KOffice Logo
- KWifiManager
- KView (get the gqview icon?)
- World Clock, Tea Cooker, AMOR
- KDE-SDK: KDevelop, Umbrello, KBugBuster, babel fish, Kompare, KDiff3, Qt Utilities
- KNetAttach
- Game Categories (Arcade, Board Games, Tactics & Strategy)
- More game icons: Atlantik, KAsteroids, etc.
- Edutainment (and Subcategories: Languages, Mathematics, Miscellaneous, Science, Teaching Tools)

Icon improvements:
- kdissert. in its current state it's completely unrecognizable at small sizes.
- fork. it's not that bad, but should be better.

other TODO items:
- let duplicate icons be symlinks (which is supported by Subversion!)
  ...which is probably a task for the Tango port rather than the KDE one.
