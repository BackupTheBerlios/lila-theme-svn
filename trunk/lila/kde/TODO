TODO list: this is what I find most important to do (in order of importance). Your opinion may differ.

Icons for
- Akregator
- Konqueror toolbar buttons: KDE 3.4 Photo View & Gwenview Image View
- Menu Editor and Menu Updating Tool
- Bookmark Tabs as Folder and Bookmark Toolbar
- KNetAttach
- Amarok (new wolf howl icon? but wait for that until the icon troubles are over)
- colored folders in filesystem/
- Konversation
- KOffice Logo
- Info Center
- KNewsTicker
- KWifiManager
- Gwenview, Kuickshow & KView (one of them could get the gqview icon)
- KGpg, KFloppy, World Clock, Tea Cooker, AMOR
- KBear
- KDE-SDK: KDevelop, Umbrello, KBugBuster, babel fish, Kompare, Qt Utilities
- Game Categories (Arcade, Board Games, Tactics & Strategy)
- Edutainment (and Subcategories: Languages, Mathematics, Miscellaneous, Science, Teaching Tools)

other TODO items:
- write an autosync-script
- Make the Superkaramba guys drop that crappy bomb as system tray icon and use their own one.
  Or better, tell them to drop the system tray icon as a whole, hardly anybody needs that.
- update all the icons to have them rendered much better from SVG source in KDE
