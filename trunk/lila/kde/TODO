TODO list: this is what I find most important to do (in order of importance). Your opinion may differ.
If you have requests or some new icons (in here or not), please leave a note in our forums.

Icons for
- KDE 3.5 - switchuser (as seen prominently in the KMenu)
- Konversation
- fileimport, and adapt fileexport
- Menu Editor and Menu Updating Tool
- Scribus
- actions/window_suppressed (the "popup blocker" icon)
- KDE 3.5 - apps: kttsd, fifteenpieces (puzzle applet), kbinaryclock
- KDE 3.5 - devices: ipod -> ipod_unmount, laptop
- Some nice KOffice Logo
- KNewsTicker
- KWifiManager
- KView (get the gqview icon?)
- KGpg, World Clock, Tea Cooker, AMOR
- KDE-SDK: KDevelop, Umbrello, KBugBuster, babel fish, Kompare, KDiff3, Qt Utilities
- KNetAttach
- Game Categories (Arcade, Board Games, Tactics & Strategy)
- More game icons: Atlantik, KAsteroids, etc.
- Edutainment (and Subcategories: Languages, Mathematics, Miscellaneous, Science, Teaching Tools)

other TODO items:
- fix the colors of the user icons (apps/personal, apps/kuser, etc.) or replace them completely
- let duplicate icons be symlinks (which is supported by Subversion!)
- update all the icons to have them rendered much better from SVG source in KDE
  > already done: devices/ (and some other single icons)

easy TODO items:
- see if there is some charismatic bitmap icon anywhere
