The lila-kde FAQ:
Questions that may or may not have been asked,
but will be answered for your enhanced lila experience.

Q. Why did it take a year until lila-kde v0.8 made its comeback?
A. In the beginning, I was wondering myself. Just when lila-kde started to
   rock, it became unmaintained. Tom Chance, also known as telex4, who was
   the creator of the original KDE port, left the project silently (while
   taking on other challenges). Anyways, the lila project, which had always
   been mostly a gnome thing, continued to evolve without the KDE port.
   Some time ago, I decided that this is bad, so here you are again
   with a new maintainer and much more icons than before.

Q. My favorite icon isn't in here! Can you draw one, please?
A. We'll see. If you want to contact the team directly, you should come to
   our site at lila-theme.berlios.de, where we all wait for your forum posts.
   If you really want to help and have some good idea, you're strongly invited
   to draw one or more icons yourself. Our web site has a tutorial how to do
   that, and the team will try to help you as good as we can.

Q. What's all this business with PNG and SVG formats?
A. You know, that's only a workaround. PNGs is a well supported bitmap files,
   storing color and opacity values for each pixel in a picture. PNG is the
   standard picture format for KDE icon themes. SVG, on the other hand, is
   a vector graphics format on the rise, which stores information about
   the geometry of the picture, like the starting and end points of lines
   or fill and border colors of all the shapes in the picture.
   The lila icon set only consists of SVG pictures, but if you want them
   to look great in KDE, you have to convert them to the PNG format.
   That's what we do for lila-kde. The gnome folks don't need that workaround,
   because they have a proper package displaying SVGs (which is called rsvg).

Q. But I heard KDE 3.4 supports SVG! You don't need the PNGs anymore, do you?
A. No, we still need them. KDE has enhanced the KSVG renderer, which renders
   SVG graphics that are taken as background image or embedded in web sites.
   Unfortunately, KSVG is too slow to render many icons in little time,
   so the KDE folks made a less capable but faster SVG engine for displaying
   icons (with serious drawbacks). This icon renderer hasn't improved with
   KDE 3.4, though I think it's only a question of time until that changes.

Q. I want to contribute to the lila project!
A. This is a FAQ, you're supposed to ask questions! Well ok, anyways.
   It's late at night, so I leave that one unanswered for now.
   At least, know that we work with a Subversion (SVN) repository where we
   store all the icons. You can do an anonymous checkout from there and
   access our latest development state. Details on anonymous SVN later.
