This document is to post notes about things done
with the tango port of Lila.

Updates for some of the weather icons.

2006-03-21 (jpetso)
Replaced some icons with their respective KDE versions, because those
have been improved a bit.


2006-03-21 (9-speed)
I downloaded tango-icon-theme-0.7.1 and replaced
all icons with Lila versions. Some icons did not
have an appropriate Lila version in my opinion.
Missing icons compared to the tango icon package
can be found using the diff tool to compare the
scalable directories.
I am still unsure about what the official icons
in a tango port should be.

* New icon system-installer
* New icon system-software-update
* New icon preferences-desktop-peripherals
* New icon video-display
* New icon face-plain
* New icon face-smile-big
* New icon face-devil-grin
* New icon x-office-presentation
* New icon user-home
* New icon battery-caution
* New icon weather-severe-alert
* New icon weather-few-clouds-night
* New icon weather-clear-night
